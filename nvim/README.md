# ðŸ’¤ FicVim

My personal Neovim configuration based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

Currently I'm using `obsidian.nvim` for note-taking.

The colorscheme is a heavily modified version of `noirbuddy.nvim`.

A note on keybindings: I use Colemak-DH, which is a non-qwerty keyboard layout. I use either `MNEI` or the arrow keys (which is a mod key + `MNEI` on my keyboard) for navigation, depending on a few different factors.

Therefore, some of these bindings may seem weird.
